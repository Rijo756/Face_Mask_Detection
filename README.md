# Face_Mask_Detection
Face Mask Detection using Inception net and haar_cascade or multi_task_CNN


The dataset is 876 images with annotation.

Transfer Learning using InceptionetV3 as pretrained network is used without training again. Additional fully connected layers are added which can be trained.

Haarcaascade is less accurate. MTCNN is fairly accurate in its prediction.


NB: Some files like inceptionV3-model is removed due to 100MB file size.
If you can run the scripts in your system this will automatically created.
